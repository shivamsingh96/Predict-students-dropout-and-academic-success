# Predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success
The aim of this project is to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
